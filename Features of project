#Project Description:
*This project involves the development of an interactive data visualization dashboard to track and analyze global trends in COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths. 
*The dashboard will provide users with real-time insights into the pandemic's impact across different countries, enabling better understanding and decision-making.

*Using reliable data sources (e.g., WHO, Johns Hopkins University), 
the dashboard will feature multiple charts and visual elements to display the progression and distribution of COVID-19 metrics over time and across geographic regions.



# Key Features:
* Line Chart – Daily New Cases:
* Displays the trend of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases globally or by selected countries.
* Helps identify spikes, waves, and the overall direction of the pandemic.
* Bar Chart – Total Cases by Country:
* Compares total confirmed cases among countries.
* Highlights the most and least affected regions.
* Pie Chart – Recovery vs Death Rate:
* Shows the proportion of recovered cases versus deaths from the total closed cases.
* Offers insights into healthcare outcomes and system effectiveness.




#Expected Outcome:
* A user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard accessible via a web interface.
* Real-time or regularly updated visualizations
